A lot of functional programming terms come from category theory, and the essence of category theory is composition.


Functors are great higher-order abstractions that allow you compose functions over the contents of a container without coupling those functions to the structure or implementation details of the functor data type. Functors form the foundation of other very useful algebraic structures, such as monads.

always starting with why.
tell a story, a scenario, a trouble in making.
how do we end up like this? how to avoid this?

explain why we need this thing.

then move on to the implementation
how we do it? 
the steps, 
the content

the last step is what

tell them what we can achieve. 
the result.
some points worth noting.
caveats/hurdles to pay attention to.
